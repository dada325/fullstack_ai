Points need to note building products powered by machine learning. A road map of skill required to quickly develop and deploy a complete ML system. 


### Deep learning Framework
;tldr, PyTorch is preferred due to its dominance in the number of models, papers, and competition winners. So there will be Pytorch and Pytorch lightling code here. Sure you can also use Tensorflow or JAX as well.


### Meta-Frameworks and Model Zoos
There are also thousands of models that already been trained on the platform to be used for free. 

1.[ONNX](https://onnx.ai/) is an open standard for saving and exchanging deep learning models

2.[Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) is a prominent model repository that initially focused on Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks but has since expanded to include a wide range of tasks such as audio classification, image classification, and object detection. 

3.[TIMM](https://github.com/rwightman/pytorch-image-models) is a collection of cutting-edge computer vision models and related code.

Here I will use Hugging face as an example.
